# ColorBot

This is a rewrite in C# of my original, private ColorBot written in JS. This bot has a lot of hardcoded values as it was only made for use in one server.

## Running

Run `ColorBot.exe` with your bot token as an argument, like
```shell
ColorBot.exe XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
